    <h1>The Voir Dire App is a interactive Jury pool database for lawyers to use during a Jury trial.</h1>
    <h2>
      It will take in a Jury pool of between 50-150 people with details about each potential juror. Each legal team:
      Prosecution and Defense, can then tag and sort potential jurors for jury duty. The application will allow the Jury
      pool to be added or removed to the Jury Box and Jury alternates fields. It will also make charts to show the Jury
      Pool and Jury Box statistics to easily access the makeup of the three Jury fields.
